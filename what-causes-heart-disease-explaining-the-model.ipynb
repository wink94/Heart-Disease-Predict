    "Of all the applications of machine-learning, diagnosing any serious disease using a black box is always going to be a hard sell. If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the *absence* of treatment, people are going to want to know **why**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on [1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124), ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests [2](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/living-with-heart-disease/medical-tests).\n",

    "Looking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: **high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking** [3](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors). According to another source [4](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack), the major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**. Note that **thalassemia**, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: **Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes**. Other factors include **stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see no reference to the 'number of major vessels', but given that the definition of heart disease is **\"...what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries\"**, it seems logical the *more* major vessels is a good thing, and therefore will reduce the probability of heart disease.\n",

    "Interestingly, this variable also shows a reduction in probability the higher it goes. What exactly is this? A search on Google brought me to the following description by Anthony L. Komaroff, MD, an internal medicine specialist [5](https://www.sharecare.com/health/circulatory-system-health/what-st-segment-electrocardiogram-ecg) .... *\"An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart's electrical activity. The waves that appear on it are labeled P, QRS, and T. Each corresponds to a different part of the heartbeat. The **ST segment** represents the heart's electrical activity immediately after the right and left ventricles have contracted, pumping blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. Following this big effort, ventricular muscle cells relax and get ready for the next contraction. During this period, little or no electricity is flowing, so the ST segment is even with the baseline or sometimes slightly above it. The faster the heart is beating during an ECG, the shorter all of the waves become. **The shape and direction of the ST segment are far more important than its length. Upward or downward shifts can represent decreased blood flow to the heart from a variety of causes, including heart attack, spasms in one or more coronary arteries (Prinzmetal's angina), infection of the lining of the heart (pericarditis) or the heart muscle itself (myocarditis), an excess of potassium in the bloodstream, a heart rhythm problem, or a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\"***\n",

    "This dataset is old and small by today's standards. However, it's allowed us to create a simple model and then use various machine learning explainability tools and techniques to peek inside. At the start, I hypothesised, using (Googled) domain knowledge that factors such as cholesterol and age would be major factors in the model. This dataset didn't show that. Instead, the number of major factors and aspects of ECG results dominated. I actually feel like I've learnt a thing or two about heart disease!\n",
